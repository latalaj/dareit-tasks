#Task 3: Python and Cloud Function

We started by learning about VIM, which is a highly configurable text editor that is commonly used by developers. We learned about its features, commands, and how to customize it to suit our needs. This was important because VIM is often used in server environments where graphical user interfaces may not be available.

Next, we learned about Cloud Functions on Google Cloud. Cloud Functions allow us to write and deploy code that runs in response to events triggered by Google Cloud services or HTTP requests. We learned about the different types of triggers, how to write functions in different programming languages, and how to deploy them to the cloud.

Finally, we wrote our first Cloud Function using Node.js. We created a simple function that takes an HTTP request, extracts a parameter from it, and returns a response. We then deployed this function to the cloud and tested it using HTTP requests.
