# Task 5: Create Cloud SQL

This repository was created as part of an assignment for a past project, and its goal was to demonstrate the process of creating a Cloud SQL instance and connecting to it using PostgreSQL services and DBeaver tool.

## Cloud SQL Instance
As part of the fifth task, we were required to create a Cloud SQL instance. We opted to use PostgreSQL as our database management system. The process involved several steps, including setting up the instance, configuring its settings, and defining access control policies.

Once the instance was up and running, we proceeded to create tables and populate them with data. We also implemented several queries to test the functionality of the database.

## DBeaver Tool
To connect to the Cloud SQL instance, we used the DBeaver tool. This tool allowed us to establish a secure connection to the database and execute queries. We found it to be a reliable and user-friendly tool that streamlined the database management process.
